== flv2mp4

This is a simple tool to convert flv files to mp4.

Just try

    ruby flv2mp4.rb some_file.flv

and it will convert it to *some_file.mp4*


If you want to convert entire dir, try

    ruby dir_flv2mp4.rb

and wait a lot!

I am interested in faster ways to convert video media, but for now, I have not so much answers.
